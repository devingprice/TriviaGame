=====

In Pirate Trivia you have 1 minute to answer 10 questions about pirates before the fuze runs out!

## How it works
* Each question has 2-4 answer choices.
* After selecting an answer, it moves onto the next question.
* If you make it through all of the questions you will defuse the bomb and see your results.
* The results page has how many you got correct (including a star rating). 
* You will also see some background on each question.
* If you run out of time, you lose and will be taken to the result screen.
* Afterwards you can play again with a randomized question set so each game is different.
